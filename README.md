## Accessing data, code and results

Download the main zip file ('RhesusSSB.zip') containing all data and code needed to reproduce results from [here](https://mega.nz/file/SnYgxYpR#ltfVPSK08AYLTTKzIbX1UtjPEK9IQMF4bCmijvP9MlM). Please note that this a large file (18.8GB), due to the storage of MCMC GLMM models as R objects. Data and code are stored across three directories: scripts are found in ‘Code’, pipeline data in ‘Use_Data’, models are stored in 'RData'. Analysis can be run using relative working directory paths out of the ‘Code’ directory using the respective R, Python and bash scripts. Steps to perform analysis are provided in the R script file ‘RhesusPipeline.R’. Analysis is performed in three stages: first the assembling of count data, second the running of Bayesian models, and finally the collation of posterior distributions of variance and further results. Additional code templates are provided for parallelised Bayesian model fitting for each bivariate model, and for stitching chains together after fitting (see script notes in RhesusPipeline.R for details).
